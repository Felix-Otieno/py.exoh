#loop is a sequence of instruction that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
#classification of loops are itarative loop and condition loop.
#Iterative is for loop while conditional loop is while loop.
#Iterative means that a set of instruction is executed repeatedly.
#condition loop means keep repeating until a certain condition is met.

# for i in range(1, 51):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(0, 51, 5):
#     print(i)

# for i in "string":
#     print(i)

# i = 1
# while i <= 50:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1

i = 0
string = "string"
while i < len(string):
    print(string[i])
